Robot Automated Configuration, Preferences and Software Installation for üñ•Ô∏è macOS + :octocat: My Awesome `.` files project

[![xkcd: Automation](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png)](http://xkcd.com/1319/)

Don't you hate getting a new laptop or joining a new team and then spending a whole day setting up your system preferences and tools? Me too. That's why we automate; we did it once and we don't want to do have to do it again.


## Installation

I suppose for those that _just want the dotfiles_ getting set up is as easy as

## \\[._.]/ - Hi, I'm the MacOS robot

I will update your MacOS machine with Better‚Ñ¢ system defaults, preferences, software configuration and even auto-install some handy development tools and apps that my developer friends find helpful.

You don't need to install or configure anything upfront! This works with a brand-new macOS machine.

## üè† First initial setup

```sh
MY_DOTFILES=$HOME/.dotfiles
git init --bare $MY_DOTFILES
alias dotfiles="git --git-dir=$MY_DOTFILES/ --work-tree=$HOME $@"
dotfiles remote add origin https://github.com/thomasgroch/dotfiles.git
```

## üöÄ Replication

```sh
MY_DOTFILES=$HOME/.dotfiles
git clone --separate-git-dir=$MY_DOTFILES https://github.com/thomasgroch/dotfiles.git dotfiles-tmp
rsync --recursive --verbose --exclude '.git' dotfiles-tmp/ $HOME/
rm --recursive dotfiles-tmp
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Configuration

```sh
dotfiles config status.showUntrackedFiles no
dotfiles remote set-url origin https://github.com/thomasgroch/dotfiles.git
```

## Usage

```sh
dotfiles status
dotfiles add .gitconfig
dotfiles commit -m 'Add gitconfig'
dotfiles push
```

# Update Replica

```sh
MY_DOTFILES=$HOME/.dotfiles
alias dotfiles="git --git-dir=$MY_DOTFILES/ --work-tree=$HOME $@"
dotfiles checkout
```


No extra tooling, no symlinks, files are tracked on a version control system, you can use different branches for different computers, you can replicate you configuration easily on new installation.

# Forget About Manual Configuration!

\\[^_^]/ - This started as [Thomas Letsch Groch](https://thomasgroch.com)'s MacOS shell configuration dotfiles but has grown to a multi-developer platform for machine configuration.


# \\[._.]/ - Watch me running

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/Sl5Qsv1EGHaJR6hcUR1No3OiD.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/Sl5Qsv1EGHaJR6hcUR1No3OiD)

![Running](http://media.giphy.com/media/5xtDarwenxEoFeIMEM0/giphy.gif)

![iTerm Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomasgroch/dotfiles/master/img/term.png)

launch fullscreen hit `Command + Enter`
iTerm, then use `Command + d` and `Command + D` to create split panes.

# Installation


```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/thomasgroch/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles;
# run this using terminal (not iTerm, lest iTerm settings get discarded on exit)
./install.sh
```
* When it finishes, open iTerm and press `Command + ,` to open preferences. Under Profiles > Colors, select "Load Presets" and choose the `Solarized Dark Patch` scheme. If it isn't there for some reason, import it from `~/.dotfiles/configs` -- you may also need to select the `Hack` font and check the box for non-ascii font and set to `Roboto Mono For Powerline` (I've had mixed results for automating these settings--love a pull request that improves this)
* I've also found that you need to reboot before fast key repeat will be enabled

> Note: running install.sh is idempotent. You can run it again and again as you add new features or software to the scripts! I'll regularly add new configurations so keep an eye on this repo as it grows and optimizes.

## Restoring Dotfiles

If you have existing dotfiles for configuring git, zsh, vim, etc, these will be backed-up into `~/.dotfiles_backup/$(date +"%Y.%m.%d.%H.%M.%S")` and replaced with the files from this project. You can restore your original dotfiles by using `./restore.sh $RESTOREDATE` where `$RESTOREDATE` is the date folder name you want to restore.

> The restore script does not currently restore system settings--only your original dotfiles. To restore system settings, you'll need to manually undo what you don't like (so don't forget to fork, review, tweak)


# 3.x.x+ Upgrade Instructions!

`3.0.0` brings huge changes. If you have made any modifications (and didn't make your own fork), you will want to backup your dotfiles prior to running `git-up` or `git pull` on `~/.dotfiles`.

Do the following to upgrade your ~/.dotfiles safely:

1. backup your dotfiles: `cp -R ~/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles_old`
2. `cd ~/.dotfiles`
3. update dotfiles: `git-up` or `git pull`
4. remove old submodule location: `rm -rf .vim` (now lives in `homedir/.vim`)
5. inspect `install.sh` and `config.js` to make sure all the software you want is installed
6. inspect `homedir/*` for any changes you want to port from `./dotfiles_old`
7. run `install.sh` again

# Additional

## VIM as IDE
I am moving away from using `Atom` and instead using `vim` as my IDE. I use Vundle to manage vim plugins (instead of pathogen). Vundle is better in many ways and is compatible with pathogen plugins. Additionally, vundle will manage and install its own plugins so we don't have to use git submodules for all of them.

## Crontab
You can `cron ~/.crontab` if you want to add my nightly cron software updates.

> \\[0_0]/ - Note that this may wake you in the morning to compatibility issues so use only if you like being on the edge

## Remap Caps-Lock
- I highly recommend remapping your Caps Lock key to Control per [Dr. Bunsen](http://www.drbunsen.org/remapping-caps-lock/):
![Remap Caps Lock](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thomasgroch/dotfiles/master/img/remap_capslock.png)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning / Liability
> Warning:
The creator of this repo is not responsible if your machine ends up in a state you are not happy with. If you are concerned, look at the code to review everything this will do to your machine :)

Unless you're sitting next to me, I wouldn't really recommend a complete
installation of these dotfiles. They might get to that polished, pristine state
at some point, but right now they're not there.

They're getting closer though.

If you insist, you can see the steps that I run through when setting up a new
[macOS laptop](osx-setup.sh) or [server](ubuntu-setup.sh). They read like
scripts, but __please don't run them like scripts__. I've never needed them to
be robust enough to be run attended; I always just copy and paste each command
one at a time in case something has changed between the last time I set up a
device and now.

__However__, my dotfiles make a heavy-handed assumption that you're using zsh +
OS X + Homebrew + iTerm2 most of the time, which is agreeable for me but maybe
unagreeable for you. This is why I wouldn't recommend just cloning the repo and
running with it. If you're looking for a solution like that, there are plenty of
excellent resources online at <https://dotfiles.github.io>.
